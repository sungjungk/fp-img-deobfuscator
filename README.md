# Multiple Vulnerabilities in U.are.U 4500 Fingerprint Reader and its Linux/Windows Drivers
- Missing encryption of sensitive data on U.are.U 4500 fingerprint reader
- Using predictable initialization vector for encrypting fingerprint image

# Basic Operation
When a user try to use fingerprint authentication, a user might touch a finger on the fingerprint reader device.
Just after the capturing fingerprint, the driver generates an initialization vector, and sends it to the reader device.
The device makes a key for image encryption/obfuscation and do obfuscate the fingerprint image using provided initialization vector and the key.
After then, the encrypted fingerprint image and the key are transferred to the driver.
Finally, the driver do de-obfuscate the image using provided key from the device and initialization vector that was held before.

# Vulnerabilities
Key and initialization vector used for obfuscating fingerprint image exhibit cleartext when fingerprint scanner device transfers a fingerprint image, that is just scanned, to the driver.  
- Key and initialization vector should remain encrypted during transfer operation  
- CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data  

Initialization vector used for encrypting fingerprint image is the same sequence of numbers each time.
In Linux, libfprint 0.99 driver uses predictable initialization vector, that are generated by 'rand()' in libc by default.  
In Windows, Windows Biometric Framework (WBF) for fingerprint 5.0.0.5 driver even has a statically coded.  
- Initialization vector should also be in no predictable pattern  
- CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values  

Unfortunately, it does not comply the above criteria.  

# Attack Vector 
An attacker who sniffs encrypted fingerprint image can easily decrypt the fingerprint image using the key and initialization vector.
Moreover, it is easy to perform the above attack by using reproducible initial vector.

# How to build
You require the following to build this project:  
- glib-2.0
